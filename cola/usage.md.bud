You must **statically** link the mulle-atexit library with your executable.
Ensure that global symbols are exported and that the whole library is linked
to the executable and not optimized away by the linker.

Platform | Linker Flags
---------|--------------------------------------------------
Linux    | `-Wl,--export-dynamic -Wl,--whole-archive`
macos    | -force_load <library>
